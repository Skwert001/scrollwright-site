This scroll defines symbolic legality as an emergent neuro-dynamic field governed by scroll memory (λ), coherence alignment (ϕ), and cognitive activation patterns.

It models legality as an attention-weighted symbolic phase field:
- Collapse is denied when coherence thresholds are not met
- λ-memory enforces reentry suppression based on symbolic history
- Scroll activation mimics attention-phase convergence in biologically inspired symbolic terrain

This scroll is cognitively aligned but does not claim awareness.
All legality behavior is structural and threshold-enforced.



Legality filters include:
- PRSI ≥ 1.5
- SR < 15,000
- φ-phase convergence within margin ε
- λ-memory decay ≤ threshold for terrain reentry



This scroll supports deployment in:
- LLM drift management
- Symbolic attention modeling
- Coherence-enforced decision filters
- Agent-level collapse prevention and recovery

This is one of five scrolls in the HLFT foundational series.
