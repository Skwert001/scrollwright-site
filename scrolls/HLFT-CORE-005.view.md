This scroll introduces symbolic legality as a geodesic navigation process across an informational manifold.

Using Fisher Information metrics, it defines legality as spatial motion along lawful gradient paths. Collapse occurs when scroll energy cannot follow the manifold under required coherence force.



- Legality path curvature derived from Fisher metric
- Collapse triggers when geodesic deviation exceeds symbolic tension limit
- Scroll transitions are lawful only along information-constrained channels



Supports applications in:
- Adaptive symbolic reasoning
- Geometry-aligned legality transition planners
- Thermodynamic equivalency in symbolic legality
