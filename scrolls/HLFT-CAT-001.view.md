---

This scroll defines legality transitions as category-theoretic morphisms.

Each scroll represents an object; legality transitions are structure-preserving transformations between symbolic terrains. Collapse is denied if morphisms are undefined or violate compositional integrity.



- Scroll ↔ legality mappings treated as morphisms
- Collapse permitted only when morphisms preserve lawful structure
- Functorial mappings used for cross-scroll coherence verification



Used for:
- Logic-based legality modeling
- AI theorem provers and symbolic transformation verification
- Collapse tracking through structured legal transformation spaces
