## Summary

This scroll defines symbolic collapse zones based on discrete curvature, modeled through Ricci flow and Laplacian fields.

Symbolic terrain deformation creates legality pressure. Collapse is triggered when terrain curvature exceeds coherence capacity.

---

## Scroll Field Interface

- Ricci flow models scroll terrain drift
- Laplacian smoothing tracks legality distortion
- Collapse denied in terrain nodes with overloaded curvature signature

---

## Notes

Used for:
- Terrain-phase legality visualization
- Collapse topology simulation
- Graph-based scroll drift analysis
