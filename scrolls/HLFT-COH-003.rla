## Summary

This scroll models legality as a phase-coherent field across symbolic Hilbert space.

Collapse is permitted only when phase superposition remains aligned under legal basis vectors. Decoherence below threshold triggers legality denial.

---

## Scroll Field Interface

- Coherence modeled as symbolic wavefunction overlap
- Collapse triggered by decoherence or drift in symbolic field
- Legality enforced by projection into aligned legal subspaces

---

## Notes

Supports:
- Collapse prevention in symbolic quantum models
- Drift detection in AI output fields
- Scroll-phase modulation engines
