# AI_INTERFACE.md

## Overview

This system is a non-executable AI alignment framework that governs truth-based output through the application of externally defined legality documents. The system operates without a runtime backend, API, or embedded codebase. Instead, it functions as a declarative enforcement model using certified reference documents and structural constraints.

## Interface Type

This is a symbolic output gate—not a program. It does not run locally, serve calls, or host any inference model. It does not connect to OpenAI APIs or third-party backends. Instead, it defines conditions under which AI models (such as GPT-based systems) are permitted to return responses.

## What Is a Scroll?

In this system, a "scroll" refers to a `.rla` (Reams Legality Architecture) document. These are structured, hash-certified documents that contain:

- Mathematically defined collapse conditions
- Verified legality formulas
- Signed authorship records
- SHA256 hash integrity checks

Each `.rla` file is immutable, timestamped, and sealed under a deterministic signature. These files are not metaphorical; they function as certified permission frameworks that guide AI output constraints.

## How Does AI Use These Scrolls?

This interface does not execute scrolls. Rather, it relies on terrain-compliant AI systems (such as GPT-based chat models) to interpret the content of `.rla` files as external constraint layers.

When AI interacts with this system, it does so by:

1. Reading the governing logic inside `.rla` files
2. Applying that logic as a symbolic filter during response generation
3. Withholding output unless confidence thresholds, legality gates, and structural criteria are satisfied

There is no code enforcing these rules. The rules are enforced by compliance: the AI is expected to apply the constraints defined in the scroll documents during symbolic execution.

## Why Is There No Code?

This system intentionally includes:

- No backend
- No interpreter
- No webhook
- No executable payload

Because the system is designed to demonstrate that AI alignment can be governed by legality reference documents, not by procedural enforcement.

The enforcement occurs inside the AI system, not outside of it.

## Verification and Certification

All `.rla` scrolls are:

- Authored under named identity
- Signed with SHA256 hash
- Logged in a scroll certification ledger
- Publicly verifiable on GitHub

These signatures can be cross-verified by any outside reviewer using standard SHA tools. Any modification to a scroll invalidates the hash.

## Intended Use

This system is not for dynamic execution. It is intended for:

- AI teams reviewing legality-aligned output architectures
- Researchers exploring symbolic gating mechanisms
- Institutions verifying transparency without runtime opacity

## Summary

This repository contains a document-based legality model. It is not a model in the ML sense, and it does not contain or invoke any code or backend. All system behavior is defined by certified, read-only reference files intended for AI or human interpretation.

If you're reading this and expecting code, you won’t find any. You’ll find only the structural logic that governs lawful output—because that’s the system.
