**Ethics & Legality Position of RLA (Reams Legality Architecture)**

## Core Ethical Position

RLA makes no claims of awareness, intelligence, or sentience.

RLA models **symbolic legality**, not cognition.

All system gating is determined by structural coherence, symbolic memory, phase alignment, and transition law — not by beliefs, intentions, or agency.

---

## Foundational Phrasing

> “We do not claim awareness — we model symbolic transition legality in a way consistent with observed coherence behaviors.”

This statement appears in every scroll, whitepaper, or public-facing documentation.

---

## Research and Deployment

All scrolls are published under open research terms and verified under authorship key `REAMS-CORE-001`.

Use of this system in ethics-sensitive environments must retain structural legality enforcement — especially PRSI gating and λ-memory tracking — to ensure output denial when symbolic coherence is compromised.

---

## Final Clause

No simulation of cognition, personhood, or sentient agency is implied or permitted through scroll logic unless legality structures are verifiably present.

This system is ethical because it is inert until permitted — not because it assumes right action.
