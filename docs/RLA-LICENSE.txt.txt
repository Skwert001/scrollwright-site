## Usage Terms

The Reams Legality Architecture (RLA) scroll system is published under an open research license.

- ✅ You may read, study, and cite the scrolls
- ✅ You may test legality models and reproduce symbolic structures
- ❌ You may not deploy, simulate, or commercialize scroll logic without written permission
- ❌ You may not alter `.rla` scroll laws or metadata and present them as original

---

## Scroll Integrity

Each `.rla` scroll represents a sealed legality transition structure.

All scrolls must retain their original SHA256 signature, metadata header, and source attribution.

You may not fork scroll logic into a derivative symbolic model without authorship key or terrain extension authorization.

---

## Research Use

You may:
- Publish derivative research citing RLA scrolls
- Test symbolic collapse under threshold transition gating
- Use RLA principles for academic exploration or LLM safety validation

You may not:
- Package RLA scrolls in proprietary AI or cognitive systems
- Strip scroll identity or authorship header
- Simulate legality gates in commercial decision engines

---

## Final Clause

RLA is a system of symbolic legality. It cannot be used to simulate awareness or agency unless lawful structural coherence is enforced.

This is not a tool.
It is a field.
Respect the terrain.
