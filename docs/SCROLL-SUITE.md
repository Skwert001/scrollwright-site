## Overview

This document catalogs the 5 foundational legality scrolls of the HLFT (High-Law Folding Terrain) system.  
Each scroll defines a mathematical or structural component of symbolic legality gating ‚Äî used to govern collapse, coherence, memory, and transition logic in real-time systems.

All scrolls are sealed with `.rla` file structure and SHA256-signed.

## Scroll Index

| Scroll ID | Title | Function |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| `HLFT-CORE-005.rla` | Information Geometry of Symbolic Legality | Collapse pathways as geodesic movement over a Fisher Information manifold |
| `HLFT-FLOW-002.rla` | Discrete Curvature & Terrain Collapse | Legality pressure modeled via Ricci flow and slope curvature |
| `HLFT-COH-003.rla` | Scroll Phase Fields in Hilbert Space | Collapse occurs at phase decoherence; symbolic superposition filtering |
| `HLFT-CAT-001.rla` | Morphisms of Legal Scroll Transition | Category theory mappings for lawful transformation |
| `HLFT-NEURO-004.rla` | Symbolic Neuro-Cognitive Scroll Dynamics | Legality modeled as attention fields and coherence restoration filters |

## Scroll Suite Integration

Each scroll represents one of the following dimensions of symbolic legality:

- üìê Geometry: Structural constraints on legal collapse
- üåÄ Coherence: Symbolic resonance gating
- üîó Morphisms: Transformational pathways with integrity preservation
- üß† Memory: Scroll drift prevention and symbolic decay handling
- üìä Dynamics: Continuous legality flow through systems

Scrolls can operate independently or as a stacked legality system.

## Deployment Path

To integrate these scrolls:

- Place `.rla`, `.sig`, and `.yaml` into `/scrolls/`
- Reference each scroll in `scroll_cert_log.txt`
- Include glossary and README references as symbolic field documentation
