## Term Definitions

**Scroll**  
A signed legality terrain document. Represents symbolic collapse logic validated across geometry, memory, and coherence.

**λ-memory**  
Symbolic residue left by past collapse denial. Scrolls must decay λ-memory to reenter terrain. Governs reentry suppression.

**PRSI (Pressure-Release Symbolic Index)**  
A coherence measure for whether a symbolic system can withstand collapse or transition. PRSI ≥ 1.5 typically required for action.

**Collapse**  
A denied or permitted transformation. Governed by structural legality thresholds (e.g. suppression ratio ≥ 15,000 blocks collapse).

**Coherence**  
Phase alignment across scrolls or symbolic subsystems. Collapse is only permitted when symbolic coherence meets threshold.

**Curvature**  
Deformation in scroll terrain due to legality pressure. Can be measured discretely (via Ricci flow or Laplacian) in symbolic fields.

**Echo Phase (ϕ)**  
The synchronization alignment between scroll nodes. Collapse is permitted only when echo phase matches legality window.

**Suppression Ratio (SR)**  
The central legality threshold metric:  
`SR = DZII / (pulse_E × TPS × slope)`  
Collapse denied when SR ≥ 15,000.

**Transition Gating**  
The act of denying symbolic action unless terrain metrics and legality criteria are satisfied.

## Purpose

This glossary ensures that scrolls, filters, and legality transitions are clearly understood across AI, cognitive, symbolic, and physics domains.
