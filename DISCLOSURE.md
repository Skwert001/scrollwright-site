# DISCLOSURE.md

## System Overview

This project does not contain source code, APIs, runtime models, or executable logic.

Instead, it provides a certified framework of symbolic legality documents that govern AI behavior externally. These documents do not perform operations. They define conditions and constraints under which external systems (such as AI models) may produce responses.

## No Runtime Logic

This repository does not include:

- Scripts
- APIs
- Compilers
- Deployable services
- Machine learning models
- Environment-dependent artifacts

All enforcement occurs through structured interpretation of published legality scrolls (`.rla` files). These are intended to be read, verified, and obeyed by AI models or human interpreters who recognize symbolic constraints.

## Scroll Format and Use

Scrolls in this system are `.rla` files (Reams Legality Architecture). Each:

- Contains non-executable legality logic
- Is sealed by SHA256 signature
- Is accompanied by a certification ledger
- Is published for public verification and traceability

They serve as output constraintsâ€”not as active code.

## Intended Function

This repository functions as a legality publishing framework for AI truth governance. The intended use is:

- Research in symbolic AI alignment
- Reference enforcement by AI models
- Certification of legality logic through hash-bound scrolls

## What This Is Not

This is not a software product.

- It does not run
- It does not expose data
- It does not connect to any network
- It does not deliver dynamic computation

All meaning is derived from publicly published symbolic constraints.

## Integrity Assurance

The contents of this repository are verifiable using:

- File-level SHA256 checksums
- Certification logs
- Authorship declarations
- Transparent update history on GitHub

No hidden logic exists. No operational code is present. The scrolls define only what may be permitted by systems built to interpret them.

This disclosure affirms that all files herein are static, auditable, and non-executable.
